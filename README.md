40.5 / 50

-1 | When sending a private message, the message doesn't show up on the sender's screen.
-.5 | No .gitignore file
-8 | Creative portion is just exactly what the main assignment is. I gave you 2 points because there was obviously effort put in to make the global chat room work, but it doesn't do anything not already part of the rest of the assignment.
